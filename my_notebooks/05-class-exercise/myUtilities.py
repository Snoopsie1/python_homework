Welcome to myUtilities module. This is a module made in a class exercise
Here is its requirements:
- the function must take 4 arguments (period_as_timedelta, time_of_day, number_of_meetings, start_date=now())
- the function should then return a list of datetimes for a series of meetings that should take place from start_date and evenly distributed throughout the period.
- create another list of number of attendents, that was actually there at each meeting.
- create a bar plot of attendance through the series of meetings.
